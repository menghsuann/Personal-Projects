Welcome to my github, where I list some recent projects.

#[A LSTM-based method for ETF close prediction](https://github.com/menghsuann/etf_prediction/blob/main/ETF_prediction.pdf)

• Constructed a smart trading system with machine learning; selected to be in the final 30 of 500 teams at T-Brain machine learning competition; published paper accepted in Technology and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI 2018)

• Applied LSTM networks, XGBoost, and SVR to predict future trends of stock prices based on price history alongside technical and chip analysis indicators; created models such as aggregation, filtering and transforming to pre-process time series data before running ML models
