Welcome to my github, where I list some recent projects.

[A LSTM-based method for ETF close prediction](https://github.com/menghsuann/etf_prediction/blob/main/ETF_prediction.pdf)

• Constructed a smart trading system with machine learning; selected to be in the final 30 of 500 teams at T-Brain machine learning competition; published paper accepted in Technology and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI 2018)

• Applied LSTM networks, XGBoost, and SVR to predict future trends of stock prices based on price history alongside technical and chip analysis indicators; created models such as aggregation, filtering and transforming to pre-process time series data before running ML models

[An Etymologically-Categorized Vocabulary Order Generator](https://github.com/menghsuann/vocab_generator/blob/main/Recommender%20system%20of%20new%20vocabulary.pdf)

• Proposed a model for supervised morphological analysis that integrates orthographic and semantic views of words. Modeled word formation in terms of morphological chains and applied for content-based recommender system by neural network

[Long-Term IoT Startup Competition](https://github.com/menghsuann/longterm_IOT/blob/main/longterm.pdf)

• Devised hardware paired with IoT talk system for intelligent aquaculture monitoring with CNN and LSTM model; monitored water conditions with real-time feedback system through cloud; transformed toxic nitrite to economically valuable glutamine; increased predictability of outcomes

[International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition](https://github.com/menghsuann/Uknow_IOT/blob/main/Team:NCKU%20Tainan:Software%20-%202016.igem.org.pdf)

• Built functional and affordable prototype for urine testing in health care using Arduino, sensor and self-layout chips; developed software to calculate data obtained by our device and translate them into the glucose concentrations with a user-friendly interface app [iGEM source](http://2016.igem.org/Team:NCKU_Tainan/Hardware)
